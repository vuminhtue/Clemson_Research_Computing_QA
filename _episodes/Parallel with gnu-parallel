Similar to Parallel with Job Array, here we use gnu-parallel.

The following batch script is used with 8 cores:

```bash
#PBS -N gnu-parallel-example
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=8:mem=1gb,walltime=00:05:00
#PBS -j oe

module add gnu-parallel

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

seq 1 8 | parallel -j8 'mkdir GNU_{}; cd GNU_{}; touch file_{}'
```
